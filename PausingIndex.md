BioMG 7810 practical day 2: Pausing index plots.
================================================

Motivated by our observations examining RNA polymerase distribuion using meta-gene plots, we next ask a specific question: Does the ratio of pause:body transcription change during prophase I?

What is the 'pausing index'?
----------------------------

The pausing index is deinfed as the ratio of reads in the pause peak to the gene body [Pause]/[Gene body].

Note that the window definitions are arbitrary. Many different definitions have been used in the literature, and there are valid arguments for all of them. The main important aspect of this type of analysis is that your results are consistent regardless of the definition of pausing index. 

You can show from first principals that the pausing index is appxosimately proportional to the rate at which Pol II is "released" from a paused state into productive elongation. I will post pictures of this if I have time before class.
